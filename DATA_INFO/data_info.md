## Visualizing the Data<br>
The density and real estate dataset were merged.<br><br> 

### Correlation Matrix

The highest correlation is between active listing count and total listing count which has a value of 97%. The next highest correlation is between average listing price and median listing price which has a value of 83%.<br><br>
The real estate dataset was partitioned into 2019 and 2021 which allows comparison of pre and post COVID. Average listing price and average listing price change will be the focus of this study. To provide a more accurate analysis, outlier was removed.<br><br> 

### Below are the charts of the states pre and post-COVID where the outliers were removed.

There is a difference in the demand of the housing. While Hawaii has constantly has the highest listing price before and after COVID, the next highest demand shifts after the pandemic. The remaining 5 top locations were District of Columbia, Massachussetts, Rhode Island, California respectively before the pandemic. During the Post-COVID, there is a change in the ranking, District of Columbia was displaced to the third while Rhode Island became second most expensive. It is followed by Massachussets. California maintained its fifth placement.
