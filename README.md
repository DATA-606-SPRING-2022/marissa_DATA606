# Impact of COVID-19 on the US Housing Market

## Introduction
Over the past decade, US home prices have experience steady growth. Location has been the chief criteria dictating the price and the potential buyer, but where is the location? After the pandemic, has the requirements for the property location changed. <br><br> 
Since March 2020, when COVID-19 virus has raged through the United States and around the world, this deadly virus had left a trail of numerous deaths and lingering effects of illnesses. To contain the spread of COVID-19, our way of life took a drastic turn. Physical presence at and long commute to work have been delegated to remote attendance in a part of the dwelling. A warm hug or a firm handshake have been replaced with six feet distance or a quick fist bump. Now, it seems the period of endemic is at hand. The luxury of working remotely is a possibility. Working from a far distance is not a barrier as long as internet infrastructure is in place. One could be in New York and be working forty hours a week in California. Once, our job dictates where one live which no longer is. <br><br>
The location of the house is an important issue to a home developer, home buyer or seller. The home developer will plan where the community will be. The creation of the community will be based on the demand of the buyer. Being able foresee the needs of the buyers will dictate the price of the property. The more in demand the location of the property is the better the asking price.<br><br>

## Research Question(s)
Has there been a change in house prices since COVID-19? <br>
Has there been a change in in-demand house location since COVID-19?<br>
Has there been a change in buyers' house buying criteria since COVID-19? <br><br>

## Dataset

## Unit of Analysis
- US County is the unit of analysis for this research. This unit is represented by the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which is 5 digit code that uniquely identifies counties in the United States.
- Population and land area dataset are joined with FIPS code to use to derive the density.
- FIPS code is also used to joined the density and real estate data which are used for visualization and machine learning.<br><br>

## Variables/Measures 
- Average listing price (counties) will be used as the dependent variable and will be to analyze during 2016 to 2021.
- Density of the area (counties) with price per square will be used to analyze between before COVID-19 (2016 to 2019) and after COVID-19 (2020 to 2021).
- There will be 25 variables used as independent variables, Avg Listing Price, Avg Listing Price M/M, Avg Listing Price Y/Y, County, Date, Density, FIPS, Median Listing Price, Median Listing Price Y/Y, Median Listing Price M/M, Rural Percentage, Rural Catagory, State, Total Listing Count.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this matrix, the highest correlation is between average listing price and median listing price which is 83%. The second highest correlation is between average listing price yy (yearly change) and median listing price yy (yearly change) which is 64%.<br><br>

In 2018 and 2019 (Pre-COVID), around 55% to 56% of the counties experience a price increase. However, in 2020 and 2021 (Post-COVID), 60% to 61% of the counties experience a price increase. Compared between 2018 and 2019 to 2020 and 2021, the counties also experience lower downs from the previous years.<br><br>

In 2021, the color for the whole United States map deepens which means there is an overall increase in average listing price. However, the West Mountain Region's, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and Montana, colors are more intense.<br><br>

In 2019, West North Midwest states, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma with a West Mountain state, Nevada, experienced a higher increases than the most of the other states. In 2021, the Western region has a better percentage increase than the Eastern region. The West Mountain states, Montana, Idaho, Utah, and Arizona, have the highest increases percentage increase of around 40% compared to around 20% in 2019.

In 2019, the predominant brown cluster begins from Midwest region going towards East. In 2021, the cluster in the Midwest region is isolated from the other regions. The formerly brown East North Central region onward to east belongs to their own cluster.<br><br><br><br>

In 2019, Berkshire and Hampshire counties belong to one cluster. Berkshire has a 139 density and 31.60 rural percentage while Hampshire has a 307 density and 21.44 rural percentage which meant Berkshire is less dense and less urban than Hampshire. In 2021, Berkshire is in its own cluster. Its average listing price rose from 631K to 975K. Hampshire clustered with Hampden. Hampden has a 570 density and 18.39 rural percentage. Both Hampshire and Worcester are more urban than Berkshire but their average listing price is around 500â€™s.<br>
